This privilege applies to confidential communications made for the purpose of obtaining or providing legal advice.\n\n### Part 2: Application of the Attorney-Client Privilege\n\n1. **Consultation with the Boy and His Father:** The boy and his father consulted with a lawyer regarding potential legal action against the pilot. During this consultation, the attorney-client privilege applies because:\n   - The boy is considered a minor and may be treated as a client in certain jurisdictions.\n   - The father, acting on behalf of his son, can also be considered a client for the purposes of the privilege.\n\n2. **Waiver of Privilege:** The privilege can be waived if the client consents to disclosure or if there are specific exceptions to the rule. However, in this case:\n   - There is no indication that the boy or his father consented to the disclosure.\n   - The privilege has not been explicitly waived.\n\n### Part 3: Presence of a Third Party\n\n**Legal Principle:** Generally, the presence of a third party during an attorney-client consultation can affect the applicability of the privilege. However, in this case:\n- The boy's father was present but did not retain the attorney for his son.\n- The presence of a third party does not necessarily breach the privilege if the communication remains confidential and is intended to be protected.\n\n### Part 4: Statement of Physical Condition\n\n**Legal Principle:** Statements made by a client regarding their physical condition are often considered privileged, even when they are not specifically seeking medical treatment. This is because such statements are typically made for the purpose of obtaining legal advice or representation.\n\n### Conclusion\n\nGiven these principles and the specific facts:\n\n- The attorney-client privilege applies to communications between the boy (or his father) and the consulting attorney.\n- There is no indication that this privilege has been waived.\n- The statement about physical condition was likely made in the context of seeking legal advice, which would be protected by the privilege.\n\nTherefore, the correct answer is:\n\n**(C) Inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.**\n\nThis conclusion is based on the fundamental principles of attorney-client privilege and its application to the specific facts presented in the scenario."}

The privilege applies when:\n   - There is an expectation of confidentiality.\n   - The communication relates to seeking or providing legal advice.\n   - The client retains the attorney for representation.\n\n2. **Scope of Confidentiality**: Generally, the privilege extends not only to communications between a lawyer and their direct client but also to third parties who are present during such consultations if they have a legitimate interest in the matter being discussed (e.g., family members).\n\n3. **Waiver of Privilege**: The privilege can be waived by:\n   - Explicitly or implicitly allowing disclosure.\n   - Filing a lawsuit, which may sometimes waive the privilege.\n\n4. **Statements of Physical Condition**: Statements made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment are generally not protected by the attorney-client privilege but rather by the doctor-patient privilege.\n\nGiven these principles:\n\n- The boy and his father consulted with an attorney regarding their potential legal case.\n- However, the father did not retain this attorney to represent his son in the lawsuit. Instead, he hired another lawyer.\n- During the consultation, the attorney may have discussed the boy's physical condition, which is relevant to a negligence suit.\n\n**Analysis of Options:**\n\n(A) **Admissible, because the attorney-client privilege was waived by the filing of the lawsuit.**\n   - This option is incorrect. The mere filing of a lawsuit does not automatically waive all privileges. The privilege can only be waived if there is an explicit or implicit consent to disclosure.\n\n(B) **Admissible, because there is no privilege of confidentiality when a person other than the client is present at the attorney-client consultation.**\n   - This option is incorrect. If the third party (the father and boy) had a legitimate interest in the matter being discussed, their presence does not necessarily negate the privilege.\n\n(C) **Inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications.**\n   - This option is correct. The communication between the attorney and the client (in this case, the father and boy) was intended to seek legal advice, which falls under the protection of the attorney-client privilege. Even though another lawyer is representing the case now, the original consultation remains privileged.\n\n(D) **Inadmissible, because it was a statement of physical condition not made for the purpose of obtaining medical treatment.**\n   - This option is incorrect. The statement of physical condition during an attorney-client consultation can still be protected by the privilege, regardless of its purpose.\n\n**Conclusion:**\n\nThe correct answer is (C) inadmissible, because the attorney-client privilege prevents such a breach of confidential communications."}
