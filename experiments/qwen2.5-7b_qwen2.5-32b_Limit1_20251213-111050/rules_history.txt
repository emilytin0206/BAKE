========== Sample 0 (mmlu_high_school_mathematics) ==========
Successful Refinements:
   [Original X] Use chain of thought reasoning to derive the answer.
   [Fixed O]    Use chain of thought reasoning to derive the answer and ensure all steps are completed for each vertex.

Generated Guideline:
Ensure prompts require a detailed, step-by-step reasoning process to reach the solution.

========== Sample 1 (mmlu_high_school_world_history) ==========
Successful Refinements:
   [Original X] Think about this logically.
   [Fixed O]    Think logically about how themes in the text connect to broader historical movements or events before concluding with your answer.

Generated Guideline:
To convert failing prompts into successful ones, ensure the prompt is specific and directs the user to connect ideas to broader contexts or frameworks before reaching conclusions.

========== Sample 2 (mmlu_high_school_physics) ==========
Successful Refinements:
   [Original X] Think about this logically.
   [Fixed O]    Ensure all units are consistent and then perform the necessary calculations.

Generated Guideline:
Clarify the steps required and ensure consistency in units before performing calculations.
