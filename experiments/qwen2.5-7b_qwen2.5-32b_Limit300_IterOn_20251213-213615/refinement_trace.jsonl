Let's break down the problem step by step.\n\n### Step 1: Understanding the Sequence\nAn arithmetic sequence of consecutive odd integers can be written as:\n\\[ a, a+2, a+4, \\ldots, a+(n-1) \\]\nwhere \\(a\\) is the first term and \\(n\\) is the number of terms in the sequence.\n\n### Step 2: Sum of the Sequence\nThe sum \\(S_n\\) of the first \\(n\\) terms of an arithmetic sequence can be calculated using the formula:\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\left(2a + (n-1)d\\right) \\]\nwhere \\(d\\) is the common difference. For consecutive odd integers, \\(d = 2\\). Therefore, the sum becomes:\n\\[ S_n = \\frac{n}{2} \\left(2a + (n-1) \\cdot 2\\right) = \\frac{n}{2} \\left(2a + 2(n-1)\\right) = n(a + n - 1) \\]\n\n### Step 3: Setting Up the Equation\nWe are given that the sum of the sequence is 240:\n\\[ n(a + n - 1) = 240 \\]\n\n### Step 4: Solving for \\(a\\)\nRearrange the equation to solve for \\(a\\):\n\\[ a + n - 1 = \\frac{240}{n} \\]\n\\[ a = \\frac{240}{n} - n + 1 \\]\n\n### Step 5: Ensuring \\(a\\) is an Odd Integer\nFor \\(a\\) to be an odd integer, \\(\\frac{240}{n} - n + 1\\) must be an odd integer. This implies that \\(\\frac{240}{n}\\) must be an even integer (since subtracting an even number from another even number results in an even number).\n\n### Step 6: Finding Divisors of 240\nWe need to find the divisors of 240 that make \\(\\frac{240}{n}\\) even. The prime factorization of 240 is:\n\\[ 240 = 2^4 \\times 3 \\times 5 \\]\nThe even divisors are: \\(2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 16, 20, 24, 30, 40, 48, 60, 80, 120, 240\\).\n\n### Step 7: Checking Each Divisor\nWe need to check which of these divisors \\(n\\) result in \\(\\frac{240}{n} - n + 1\\) being an odd integer.\n\n- For \\(n = 2\\):\n  \\[ a = \\frac{240}{2} - 2 + 1 = 120 - 2 + 1 = 119 \\] (odd)\n- For \\(n = 4\\):\n  \\[ a = \\frac{240}{4} - 4 + 1 = 60 - 4 + 1 = 57 \\] (odd)\n- For \\(n = 6\\):\n  \\[ a = \\frac{240}{6} - 6 + 1 = 40 - 6 + 1 = 35 \\] (odd)\n- For \\(n = 8\\):\n  \\[ a = \\frac{240}{8} - 8 + 1 = 30 - 8 + 1 = 23 \\] (odd)\n- For \\(n = 10\\):\n  \\[ a = \\frac{240}{10} - 10 + 1 = 24 - 10 + 1 = 15 \\] (odd)\n- For \\(n = 12\\):\n  \\[ a = \\frac{240}{12} - 12 + 1 = 20 - 12 + 1 = 9 \\] (odd)\n- For \\(n = 16\\):\n  \\[ a = \\frac{240}{16} - 16 + 1 = 15 - 16 + 1 = 0 \\] (not odd)\n\n### Step 8: Counting Valid Sequences\nThe valid values of \\(n\\) are 2, 4, 6, 8, and 10. For each of these, we have a unique sequence.\n\nThus, there are 5 sequences that sum"}

Let's denote the first term of the sequence by \\(a\\) and the number of terms by \\(n\\).
