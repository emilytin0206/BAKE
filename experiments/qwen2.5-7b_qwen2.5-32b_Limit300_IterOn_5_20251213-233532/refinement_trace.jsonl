The probability of no sun and no rain, which can be written as \\( P(S^c \\cap R^c) = 0.30 \\).\n\nFirst, we need to find the probability of rain:\n\\[ P(R) = 1 - P(R^c) = 1 - 0.40 = 0.60. \\]\n\nNext, we use the fact that \\( P(S^c \\cap R^c) = 0.30 \\). This means that there is a 30% chance of no rain and no sun.\n\nTo find the probability of both rain and sun, we need to consider the complement events and the total probability space. The probability of either event (rain or no rain) plus the probability of either event (sun or no sun) must sum up to 1 when considering all possible outcomes.\n\nThe probability of at least one of the following happening: rain or sun is:\n\\[ P(R \\cup S) = 1 - P((R^c \\cap S^c)) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.70. \\]\n\nNow, we use the principle of inclusion and exclusion for two events to find \\( P(R \\cap S) \\):\n\\[ P(R \\cup S) = P(R) + P(S) - P(R \\cap S). \\]\nWe know \\( P(R) = 0.60 \\), so:\n\\[ 0.70 = 0.60 + P(S) - P(R \\cap S). \\]\n\nTo find \\( P(S) \\), we use the fact that the probability of no sun is:\n\\[ P(S^c) = 1 - P(S). \\]\nSince \\( P(S^c \\cap R^c) = 0.30 \\), and knowing \\( P(R^c) = 0.40 \\), we can find \\( P(S^c | R^c) \\):\n\\[ P(S^c | R^c) = \\frac{P(S^c \\cap R^c)}{P(R^c)} = \\frac{0.30}{0.40} = 0.75. \\]\nThus, \\( P(S | R^c) = 1 - 0.75 = 0.25 \\).\n\nNow we can find \\( P(S) \\):\n\\[ P(S) = P(S | R)P(R) + P(S | R^c)P(R^c) = (1 - 0.60) \\cdot 0.40 + 0.25 \\cdot 0.60 = 0.40 \\cdot 0.40 + 0.25 \\cdot 0.60 = 0.16 + 0.15 = 0.31. \\]\n\nNow we can find \\( P(R \\cap S) \\):\n\\[ 0.70 = 0.60 + 0.31 - P(R \\cap S). \\]\nSolving for \\( P(R \\cap S) \\):\n\\[ P(R \\cap S) = 0.60 + 0.31 - 0.70 = 0.21. \\]\n\nHowever, we need to recheck the calculation as it seems there might be a simpler way or a miscalculation in the intermediate steps. Let's use the direct approach:\n\\[ P(R) + P(S) - P(R \\cap S) = 0.70. \\]\nSince \\( P(S) = 1 - P(S^c) = 1 - (P(S^c | R^c) \\cdot P(R^c)) = 1 - (0.75 \\cdot 0.40) = 1 - 0.30 = 0.60 + 0.25 \\cdot 0.60 = 0.60 + 0.15 = 0.31. \\]\n\\[ P(R \\cap S) = 0.70 - 0.91 + 0.30 = 0.24. \\]\n\nThus, the probability of both rain and sun is:\n\\["}
