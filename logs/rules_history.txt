========== Sample 0 (mmlu_high_school_mathematics) ==========
Successful Refinements:
   [Original X] Think about this logically.
   [Fixed O]    Identify how each point is transformed under a given geometric operation, list the new coordinates, and cross-reference them with the provided options to find the one that matches.

Generated Guideline:
Summarized Guideline: Provide clear, structured instructions that引导思考或解决问题的明确、有结构的指令，强调逐步分析和详细解释。

注意：最后部分我转换成了中文，因为直接翻译“emphasize step-by-step analysis and detailed explanation”到英文显得重复。如果需要完全用英文表述，可以这样修改：

Summarized Guideline: Provide clear, structured instructions that emphasize step-by-step analysis and detailed explanation.

========== Sample 1 (mmlu_high_school_mathematics) ==========
Successful Refinements:
   [Original X] Solve this problem by breaking it down into smaller parts.
   [Fixed O]    Define all variables and use relevant formulas before solving for each variable step-by-step until reaching a final conclusion.

Generated Guideline:
Ensure prompts specify clear, logical steps and encourage methodical problem-solving.

========== Sample 3 (mmlu_high_school_world_history) ==========
Successful Refinements:
   [Original X] Take a deep breath and work on this problem step-by-step.
   [Fixed O]    Analyze each part carefully, providing reasons for excluding irrelevant options before reaching a final answer based on how well an option aligns with the given context.

Generated Guideline:
Ensure prompts are specific, directive, and require analytical reasoning rather than broad instructions. Focus on detailed analysis and logical exclusion of options based on contextual relevance.
