The model output stops abruptly after listing the transformation rule for reflection across the line \( y = x \). It seems that the model did not complete the task of applying this transformation to each vertex and identifying one of the vertices of P’. This suggests a need for more explicit instructions on completing the calculation and providing a final answer.
