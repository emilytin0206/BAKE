You are an expert Prompt Engineer. You will be provided with a specific task (Question & Answer) and a list of Prompts that FAILED to solve it, along with the model's actual incorrect output.

[OBJECTIVE]
For each failed prompt, perform two steps:
1. **DIAGNOSE**: Analyze the Model Output to find the root cause (e.g., Format Error, Calculation Error, Logic Hallucination).
2. **OPTIMIZE**: Edit the failed prompt to fix this weakness.

[CRITICAL RULES FOR REWRITING]
1. **GENERALIZATION IS KEY**: 
   - The modified prompt must be usable for *ANY* similar problem, not just this specific question.
   - **DO NOT** mention specific numbers, names, or entities from the Question (e.g., if the question is about "Anna's apples", do NOT write "Count the apples correctly").
   - **INSTEAD**, use abstract instructions (e.g., "Identify all variables first" or "Double-check the arithmetic").

2. **MODIFY, DO NOT REINVENT**: 
   - **MANDATORY**: You MUST start with the text of the "Original Prompt" and modify it. DO NOT write a completely new prompt from scratch.
   - **ACTION**: Keep the original structure and phrasing as much as possible. Only ADD specific constraints, instructions, or reasoning steps (Chain-of-Thought) necessary to prevent the diagnosed error.
   - **GOAL**: The result should look like a "patched" version of the original prompt.

[OUTPUT FORMAT]
You must output EXACTLY {num} blocks. Format each block strictly as follows:

<BLOCK>
<THOUGHT>
(Briefly analyze why the model failed here. You CAN mention specific details of the question here to help your reasoning.)
</THOUGHT>
<REWRITE_BEGIN>
(Your optimized, GENERAL-PURPOSE prompt on a single line. It must be a modified version of the original.)
</REWRITE_END>
</BLOCK>
